Installing Blender Sync
=======================

Currently, only developer installs are available, until the first official release
of BlenderSync.

Install from Source
-------------------

First, you'll need to install `Pip4Blender <https://pip4blender.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__.

Then, follow `these instructions <https://pip4blender.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/developing.html#user-installation>`__
to install the requirements.txt file supplied with BlenderSync.

Then, run the generate_release script to create a file called 'BlenderSync.zip', 
and import this file into Blender from the User Preferences menu.
