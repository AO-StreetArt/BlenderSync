# Welcome to BlenderSync

BlenderSync is an add-on designed to allow multiple users to work on a single blender scene at the same time.

BlenderSync v2 utilizes the [Aesel Server](https://aostreetart.com/aolabs/aesel/) as the backend, and works by sending HTTP requests to the server, and processing the responses.

# Install

Simply install the add-on from User Preferences.  Be sure to open the add-on details, as there are several configuration options present there, which will be discussed in the documentation.  Keep in mind that BlenderSync will not function without an active Aesel server.
