Blender Sync
============

Blender Sync allows for collaborative animation using Blender.  It has several
pieces of functionality designed to enable true cloud-based workflows within
a Blender installation on your desktop.

Features
--------

Asset Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Store, browse, and share all of your assets in the cloud.  Make sure your team
always has the latest assets with real version-control.

Scene Management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Your Blender Scene is just one of many that will eventually
come together to form your project.  Stop worrying about complex file structures
and links, and start managing your projects completely in the cloud.

Object Replication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Object movements within a scene can be replicated in
real-time across many animators working on the same scene.  This means your team
can constantly see each-other's work as it's happening, providing a platform
for collaboration.

Security
~~~~~~~~
Your project is valuable, so BlenderSync carefully protects your data.  All data
is sent using the latest authorization protocols and encryption algorithms, and
data in the cloud is stored in fully secured enterprise databases.

Aesel
-----

BlenderSync utilizes `Aesel <https://aesel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ as
the back-end server which drives all functionality.  Therefore, you should
either have `Aesel installed <https://aesel.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/install.html>`__,
or have access to an existing Aesel Cloud in order to use BlenderSync.
